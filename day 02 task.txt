1.write a blog on the difference between document objects and window objects?

    >[Scope and Responsibilities]:
                       
                       The document object represents the content of the HTML document loaded in the browser window and is responsible for DOM manipulation.
                       The window object represents the browser window itself and manages browser-related functionalities and global JavaScript execution.

    >[DOM Manipulation vs. Browser Interaction]:
                    
                       The document object provides methods and properties for accessing and modifying the structure and content of the HTML document, enabling DOM manipulation.
                       The window object offers methods for interacting with the browser, such as displaying dialog boxes 
                        (alert, confirm, prompt), managing browser history (history), and controlling the browser window (open, close, resizeTo).

    >[Hierarchy and Relationship]:
                       The document object is a property of the window object. It represents the DOM document 
                       displayed in the browser window and is accessible via window.document or simply document.While the document object deals 
                       with the content of the HTML document, the window object encapsulates the entire browser environment and serves as the 
                       global context for JavaScript execution.

    >[ Content vs. Browser Environment]:
                       
                       The document object focuses on managing the structure, content, and styling of HTML elements within 
                       the document, facilitating dynamic updates and interactivity.the window object provides access to browser-specific functionalities, 
                      such as controlling the browser window, handling events, managing timers, and interacting with the user via dialog boxes.

    >[Global Scope and Variables:]

                    All global variables, functions, and objects are properties of the window object. Variables declared in the global scope are accessible as properties of window.
                    The document object does not directly hold global variables or functions but provides methods and properties for interacting with the DOM 
                    document within the browser window.
